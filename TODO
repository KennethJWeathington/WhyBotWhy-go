Todo:

  Core:
    ☐ Write unit tests for chatclient and command and get tests running in vscode
    ☐ Gather a list of template tags and commands needed to support old functionality
    ☐ Get a database image built
    ☐ Write scripts to insert metadata and test data into db
    ☐ Implement Gorm
    ☐ Implement logic to determine if an incoming private message is from a moderator/host in chatclient

  Improvements:
    ☐ Check if string passed into parse command func needs at least length of two?
    ☐ Might need to either set up a lock on chatClient.sayIncomingMessages or only allow one output channel
    ☐ Implement signal channels created in/from StartListening and StartChatting to stop the bot
